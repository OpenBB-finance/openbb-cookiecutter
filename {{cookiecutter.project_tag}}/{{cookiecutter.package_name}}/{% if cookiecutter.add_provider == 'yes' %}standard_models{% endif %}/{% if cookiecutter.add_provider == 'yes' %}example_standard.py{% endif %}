"""Example OpenBB Standard.

Look inside `openbb_sdk/sdk/provider/openbb_provider/standard_models` to see
standardized data structures from the OpenBB SDK.

These standard models help give a consistent shape to data. This means that users
can know what to expect every time they use a command. They can tell which parts
are standard and which parts might change based on the provider.

If a provider has more fields that are not in the standard models, they can inherit the
standard and add them. For QueryParams, these are called extra_params. Any other added
details will just show up with the regular output data.

Here's a basic example of the QueryParams and Data structures.
